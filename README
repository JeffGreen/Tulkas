--- TULKAS ---


"Greatest in strength and deeds of prowess is Tulkas... he rides no steed, for he can outrun all things that go on
feet, and he is tireless.  He has little heed for either the past or the future, and is of no avail as a counsellor,
but is a hardy friend." (J.R.R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion, "Valaquenta")
